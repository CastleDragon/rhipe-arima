<h3><a name="examples" class="anchor" href="#examples"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Examples</h3>

<p>A base example is provided, working on the Flight Data that can be found <a href="http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html">here</a></p>
<pre>
<code>
    $ Rscript rhipe_arima.R /tmp/airport_deps_sample /analytics/arima/airport days 4
</code>
</pre>
<ul>
    <li>
        The first argument after rhipe_arima.R is the input file.
    </li>
    <li>
        The first argument after rhipe_arima.R is the input file.
    </li>
    <li>
        The third is how to aggregate the data. Possible values for this third argument are days,hours,minutes,secs.
    </li>
    <li>
        The fourth is the threshold, in standard deviations, a residual must be above to be emitted
    </li>
</ul>

    This image shows a sample of how you could visualize the results of this example. It shows number of departures per day for each airport and using the results of the analytic
    plots marks the days when the standardized residual is greater than 4.
